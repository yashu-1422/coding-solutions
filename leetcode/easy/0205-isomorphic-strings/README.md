# Isomorphic Strings

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`,  *determine if they are isomorphic*.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  s = "egg", t = "add"

 **Output:**  true

 **Explanation:** 

The strings `s` and `t` can be made identical by:

- Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
- Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  s = "f11", t = "b23"

 **Output:**  false

 **Explanation:** 

The strings `s` and `t` can not be made identical as `'1'` needs to be mapped to both `'2'` and `'3'`.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  s = "paper", t = "title"

 **Output:**  true

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- t.length == s.length
- s and t consist of any valid ascii character.

    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
         int[] m1 = new int[256], m2 = new int[256];
          int n = s.length();
          for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
              // Return false if mapping is inconsistent
              if (m1[s.charAt(i)] != m2[t.charAt(i)]) return false;
  
              // Update last seen index for both characters
              m1[s.charAt(i)] = i + 1;
              m2[t.charAt(i)] = i + 1;
          }
  
          // Return true if all character mappings are consistent
          return true;
      }
    }

```
