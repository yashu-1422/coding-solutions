# Maximum Building Height

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

- The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
- The height of the first building must be 0.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed 1.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti]` indicates that building `idi` must have a height  **less than or equal to**  `maxHeighti`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear  **at most once**  in `restrictions`, and building `1` will  **not**  be in `restrictions`.

Return  *the  **maximum possible height**  of the  **tallest**  building*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest building has a height of 2.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 6, restrictions = []
Output: 5
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,4,5], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= n <= 109
- 0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 105)
- 2 <= idi <= n
- idi is unique.
- 0 <= maxHeighti <= 109
